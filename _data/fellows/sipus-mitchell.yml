Mitchell has 15 years of on-the-ground experience researching and designing new approaches to the world's most challenging environments. He is a pioneer in the application of community level urban informatics within fragile states and developing nations. He is a cofounder of the machine learning and data analytics company Symkala which leverages breakthrough technologies from robotics to assist non-technical subject experts.

Since 2004, Mitchell has built organizations for social change and since 2007 designed new technologies to upgrade refugee camps, reduce poverty in global slums, and advance education in conflict zones. From 2011-2014 he advised the governments of Afghanistan and Somalia on conflict stabilization and urban reconstruction. During this time Mitchell created Africa's first local-level informatics systems to stabilize and rebound from conflict.  In these capacities, Mitchell developed novel applications of human centered UX Design and human computer interaction (HCI)to geospatial technology and social data collection. Additional clients have included the US Army Corps of Engineers and the US Institute of Peace with projects throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa.

Today Mitchell advances his expertise in Informatics, Complex Urbanism, and HCI beyond dangerous geographies. He has facilitated NASA's strategic planning for 2030 on necessary infrustructures for autonomous vehicles. He has spoken widely at institutions such as MIT, Harvard, Columbia Earth Institute,and Oxford University. His work has been featured in a variety of popular outlets including WIRED, Popular Science, Forbes, Gizmodo and publications by American Planning Association and the Urban Land Institute."
